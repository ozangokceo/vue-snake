# Desciption
Live: https://vuesnake-ozangokceo.netlify.app/

This is a snake game made with Vue3 and Typescript. It's coded in 3 hours and still has some bugs.
Used Vue project scaffolding, with typescript template..

Also used Vuetify for some UI components (buttons and selects etc..)

Main component for game logic & page ==> src/components/TheSnake.vue
# TO-DO's:
- Fix Collision detection with snake itself (collision detection currently works for map boundaries)
- Exclude snake itself from random food rendering
- Reset game logic
